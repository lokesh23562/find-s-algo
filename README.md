This is a Machine Learning lab experiment

The experiment is based on the Find-S Algorithm

Find-S is used to find the maximum specific hypothesis

It learns only from positive training examples

Negative examples are ignored

The hypothesis is gradually generalized

This project is simple and beginner-friendly

Useful for understanding basic concept learning in ML
